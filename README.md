# Terminal config for my Mac
I like having Solarized as my theme, vi as my terminal shell as well as displaying my current git branch and colouring all of this to make it super clear.

# Prerequisites

* Install Brew
* Install oh-my-zsh
* Webstorm

# Installation
1. Place .zshrc at ~/
2. Place .vimrc at ~/
3. Download [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and unzip
